# Looking Notes

This is a companion to [Purdom Lindblad's](https://github.com/Purdom) *Looking Aids* project. This is an area where she can keep a reading journal, encoded with RDFa, and then [visualize the data](http://purdom.org/books/).

But Purdom reads a lot, and blogging or writing consistently is hard. Marking the posts up with RDFa is also a PITA. To make that work, we also need to have an editor that will help. I've started thinking about that. However, that won't address the fundamental problem: a writing habit is hard to start and hard to maintain.

That's where this comes in. This will make entering the initial data much easier. As easy as snapping a picture with your phone and tapping the screen a few times.

# What will this do?

This will scan ISBN numbers, pull up information about the books, and track when you're done with the book (or optionally how long it took you to read it).

From there, it will serve the data as [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/). That way, it can be integrated into the existing system with almost no effort.

# Great! How can I use it?

No idea yet. It isn't deployed anywhere.

But I'm working on it.
